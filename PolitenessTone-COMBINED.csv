ICLR,B11bwYgfM_R1,Please refer to the paper Discovering structure in multiple learning tasks : The TC algorithm published in ICML 1996 .,4,5,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R1,"One issue of the use of cross task transfer performance to measure task relations is that it ignores the negative correlations between tasks , which is useful for learning from multiple tasks .",5,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R2,"Learning incoherent sparse and low rank patterns from multiple tasks ( KDD ) In particular , [ 5 ] assumes that the combined weight matrix ( for all the tasks ) follows the robust PCA model .",3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R2,"However , a disadvantage of the proposed method is that it is a two step approach ( first perform task clustering , then re learn the cluster weights ) , while [ 5 ] is not .",3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R2,- Comparison with existing clustered MTL methods mentioned above are missing .,4,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R2,"- As mentioned above , the proposed method can be computationally expensive ( when used for MTL ) , but no timing results are reported .",4,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,"Prior techniques which can address some of these aspects do not necessarily work with deep learning , which is a key focus of the paper .",3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,"I think there are some interesting ideas in this paper , and the use of matrix completion techniques to deal with a large number of tasks is nice .",3,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,But I believe there are important drawbacks in the framing and basic methodology and evaluation which make the paper unfit for publication in its current form .,3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,The pairwise similarity measure appears to be one that might have a high false negative rate .,3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,I do not see how you apply the model from task i to task j when the two have different output spaces .,4,2,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,"Since this is a major motivation of the paper , I actually do not see how the setup makes sense !",2,1,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,The inducing of edges in the Y matrix by comparing to a mean and standard deviation is completely baseless .,4,2,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,"Without good reasoning from the authors , I see no reason why the entries in the row of a matrix should have a normal like distribution .",2,2,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,"In this case , the means are standard deviations do not even make sense to me .",2,2,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,"At the very least , I would consider using regret to the model of the task , and compute some quantiles on that which is still suspect in the matrix completion setting .",4,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,"If the error rates are different for different tasks , it is not sensible to measure raw accuracies .",4,2,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,"The authors also seem to miss a potentially relevant baseline in Cross Stitch Networks. Besides these major issues , there are also a few minor issues I have with the paper .",4,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,"Given this , the presentation in the paper makes the idea look more novel than it is .",2,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B11bwYgfM_R3,"I also think that the authors might benefit from dropping the whole few shot learning angle here , and instead do a more thorough job of evaluating their multitask learning method .""",4,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R1,Contribution : - This paper proposes a new object counting module which operates on a graph of object proposals .,3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R1,Cons : - The proposed model is pretty hand crafted .,2,2,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R1,"I would recommend the authors to use something more general , like graph convolutional neural networks or graph gated neural networks.",4,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R1,- One major bottleneck of the model is that the proposals are not jointly finetuned .,3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R1,The paper didnt study what is the recall of the proposals and how sensitive the threshold is .,4,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R1,- The paper doesnt study a simple baseline that just does NMS on the proposal domain .,4,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R1,This is similar to a density map approach and the problem is that the model doesnt develop a notion of instance .,3,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R1,"- Since the authors have mentioned in the related work , it would also be more convincing if they show experimental results on CL Conclusion : - I feel that the motivation is good , but the proposed model is too hand crafted .",5,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R1,Therefore I recommend reject .,1,2,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R1,"The rebuttal is convincing and I decided to increase my rating , because adding the proposed counting module achieve 5 % increase in counting accuracy .",3,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R2,""" Summary - This paper mainly focuses on a counting problem in visual question answering ( VQA ) using attention mechanism .",3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R2,Strengths - The proposed model begins with reasonable motivation and shows its effectiveness in experiments clearly .,3,5,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R2,"Weaknesses - Although the proposed model is helpful to model counting information in VQA , it fails to show improvement with respect to a couple of important baselines : prediction from image representation only and from the combination of image representation and attention weights .",5,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R2,"It is not clear if the value of count "" c "" is same with the final answer in counting questions .",2,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R3,"this method is built on a series of heuristics without sound theoretically justification , and these heuristics cannot be easily adapted to other machine learning applications .",3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R3,I believe the overall contribution is not sufficient for ICLR .,1,2,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R3,Well written paper with clear presentation of the method .,3,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B12Js_yRb_R3,Can the author provide analysis on scalability the proposed method ?,4,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R1,This is quite an interesting paper with a sensible goal. It seems like the method could be more informative than the other methods .,3,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R1,"It would be v interesting ( and provide a good baseline ) to use a shallow network ( i.e . PCA ) instead , and elucidate what advantages the deep network brings .",5,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R1,The reconstructions show poor detail relative to the originals .,2,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R1,"* Overall : the paper contains an interesting idea , but given the deficiencies raised above I judge that it falls below the ICLR threshold .",3,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R2,The proposed method uses - a generator trained in a GAN setup - an autoencoder to obtain a latent space representation - a method inspired by adversarial sample generation to obtain a generated image from another class.,3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R2,It would be great if the authors could come up with an additional way to demonstrate their method to the non medical reader .,4,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R2,The authors train their system with the testdata included which leads to very different visualizations .,3,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R2,This looks very noisy and non interesting .,2,2,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R3,This focus is mainly on medical image classification but the approach could potentially be useful in many more areas .,2,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R3,This gives an image that is similar to the original but with features that caused the classification of the disease removed .,3,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R3,The resulting image can be subtracted from the original encoding to highlight problematic areas .,4,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R3,"The idea in the paper is , to my knowledge , novel , and represents a good step toward the important task of generating interpretable visual rationales .",3,4,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R3,"There are a few details missing , like the batch sizes used for training ( it is difficult to relate epochs to iterations without this ) .",4,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13EC5u6W_R3,"It is also a little confusing that you begin this paragraph saying that you are doing a classification task , but then it seems like a regression task which may be postprocessed to give a classification .",4,3,Deap,16-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R1,"Section 4.1 states""We use a method similar to the DAGGER algorithm "" , but what is your method .",2,2,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R1,"- I do not understand the purpose of "" input injection "" nor where it is used in the paper .",2,2,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R1,The method is simple but novel,3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R1,Figure 2 : the plots are too small .,3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R1,The paper cites many previous approaches to this but does not compare against any of them .,4,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R1,- A second testbed ( such as navigation or manipulation ) would bring the paper up a notch .,4,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R1,The method is clear but not precisely described .,3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R2,"PLAID masters several distinct tasks in sequence , building up skills by learning related tasks of increasing difficulty .",3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R2,"- Although the main focus of this paper is on continual learning of related tasks , the authors acknowledge this limitation and convincingly argue for the chosen task domain .",3,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R3,But I find the paper lacking a lot of details and to some extend confusing .,2,2,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R3,Please first of all make the figures much larger .,3,5,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R3,"ICLR does not have a strict page limit , and the figures you have are hard to impossible to read .",4,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R3,"Indeed , because the retention of tasks is done by distilling all of them jointly , one baseline is to keep finetuning a model through the 5 stages , and then at the end after collecting the 5 policies you can do a single consolidation step that compresses all .",5,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R3,Please say in the main text that details in terms of architecture and so on are given in the appendix .,4,5,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B13njo1R-_R3,"But I want to make sure the authors put a bit more effort into cleaning up the paper , making it more clear and easy to read .",3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R1,The goal is to avoid recurrent which is sequential and hence a bottleneck during both training and inference .,4,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R1,The proposed model is convincing and the paper is well written .,3,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R1,The proposed data augmentation is a general one and it can be used to improve the performance of other models as well .,3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R1,I think it is ok to have some deterioration in the performance as you have a good speedup when compared to other models .,4,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R1,3 . The paper can be significantly strengthened by adding at least one more reading comprehension dataset .,4,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R1,"Given the sufficient time for rebuttal , I am willing to increase my score if authors report results in an additional dataset in the revision .",3,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R1,Please be consistent .,2,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R2,"Firstly , I suggest the authors rewrite the end of the introduction .",4,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R2,The current version tends to mix everything together and makes the misleading claim .,3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R2,The novelty is limited but it is a good idea to speed up the RC models .,3,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R2,"However , as the authors hoped to claim that this module could contribute to both speedup and RC performance , it will be necessary to show the RC performance of the same model architecture , but replacing the CNNs with LSTMs .",5,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R2,I feel that the model design is the main reason for the good overall RC performance .,3,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R2,"However , in the paper there is no motivation about why the architecture was designed like this .",4,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R2,it is not convincing that the system design has good generalization .,4,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R2,I like the idea of data augmentation with paraphrasing .,3,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14TlG-RW_R3,"At the moment , the description in section 3 is fuzzy in my opinion .",3,2,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R1,Importance : Understanding the landscape ( local vs global minima vs saddle points ) is an important direction in order to further understand when and why deep neural networks work .,3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R1,"To the best of my understanding , the paper has some misconceptions .",2,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R1,"Another issue is the fact that , on my humble opinion , the main text looks like a long proof .",2,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R1,"The paper mainly focuses on a specific problem instance , where the weight vectors are unit normed and orthogonal to each other .",3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R1,"The paper reads like a collection of lemmas , with no verbose connection .",4,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R1,"It was hard to read and understand their value , just because mostly the text was structured as one lemma after the other .",4,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R2,""" In this paper the authors studied the theoretical properties of manifold descent approaches in a standard regression problem , whose regressor is a simple neural network .",3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R2,"I also appreciate the effort of developing theoretical results for deep learning , even though the current results are restrictive to very simple NN architectures .",4,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R2,"The analysis becomes considerably more complicated , and the contribution seems to be novel and significant .",3,4,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R2,I am not sure why did the authors mentioned the work on over parameterization though .,3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R2,"While the Re LU activation is very common in NN architecture , without more motivations I am not sure what are the impacts of these results .",4,2,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R2,"While I appreciate the technical contributions , in order to improve the readability of this paper , it would be great to see more motivations of the problem studied in this paper ( even with simple examples ) .",4,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B14uJzW0b_R3,""" This paper considers a special deep learning model and shows that in expectation , there is only one unique local minimizer .",3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B16_iGWCW_R1,Its not clear what kind of loss function is really being optimised here .,4,2,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B16_iGWCW_R1,"It feels like it should be the same , but the tweaks applied to fix weights across all samples for a class doesnt make it not clear what is that really gets optimised at the end .",4,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B16_iGWCW_R1,"And crudely speaking , you can think of a class weight to be the expectation of its sample weights and you will end up in a similar setup .",3,3,Deap,28-11-2022,,,,
,B16_iGWCW_R1,"- Experimentally , paper would benefit with better comparisons and studies : 1 ) state of the art methods havent been compared against ( e.g . Image Net experiment compares to 2 years old method ) 2 ) comparisons to using normal Ada Boost on more complex methods havent been studied ( other than the MNIST ) 3 ) comparison to simply ensembling with random initialisations .",5,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16_iGWCW_R1,Paper would benefit from writing improvements to make it read better .,3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16_iGWCW_R2,The wrongly classified samples get large weights such that in the next round those samples will be more likely to get right .,3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16_iGWCW_R2,Thus the learned weak learner at this round will make different mistakes .,3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16_iGWCW_R2,This paper instead designed a new boosting method which puts large weights on the category with large error in this round .,3,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16_iGWCW_R2,"Experiments show its usefulness though experiments are limited """,4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16_iGWCW_R3,There is hardly any baseline compared in the paper .,4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R1,""" The paper addresses the problem of learners forgetting rare states and revisiting catastrophic danger states .",3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R1,The authors propose to train a predictive fear model that penalizes states that lead to catastrophes .,3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R1,Judging from the description of the experiments this parameter is important to the performance of the method and needs to be set experimentally .,4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R1,No empirical results on the effect of the parameter are given .,4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R1,This problem does not seem to be really solved by this method .,2,2,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R1,It would therefore be interesting to see some long running experiments and analyse how often catastrophic states ( or those close to them ) are visited .,4,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R1,"The paper also does not compare to any other techniques that attempt to deal with catastrophic forgetting and/or the changing state distribution ( [ 1,2 ] ) .",4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R1,The motivation in the appendix is very informal and no clear derivation is provided .,4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R1,"Any optimal policy would therefore need to spend some time e in the danger state , on average .",3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R1,It wasnt clear what assumptions the authors make to exclude situations like this .,2,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R2,It seems that catastrophe states need to be experienced at least once .,3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R3,""" The paper studies catastrophic forgetting , which is an important aspect of deep reinforcement learning ( RL ) .",3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R3,"I believe this observation , though not entirely novel , will inspire many researchers to study catastrophic forgetting and propose improved strategies for handling these issues .",3,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R3,"The paper is accurate , very well written ( apart from a small number of grammatical mistakes ) and contains appealing motivations to its key contributions .",3,5,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R3,"In fact , it is not difficult to design examples for which the proposed algorithm would be far from optimal .",3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B16yEqkCZ_R3,A potential weakness with the paper is that the proposed strategies appear to be simple to improve upon and that they have not convinced me that they would yield good performance on a wider set of problems .,4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B17JTOe0-_R1,The paper is overall quite interesting and the study is pretty thorough : no major cons come to mind .,3,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B17JTOe0-_R1,That seems important to explain more thoroughly than is done in the current text .,2,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B17JTOe0-_R2,"While ICLR is not focused on neuroscientific studies , this paper clearly belongs here as it shows what representations develop in recurrent networks that are trained on spatial navigation .",3,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B17JTOe0-_R2,The paper mentions a metabolic cost that is not specified in the paper .,3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B17JTOe0-_R2,I am puzzled why is the error is coming down before the boundary interaction ?,3,2,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B17JTOe0-_R3,"The manuscript is not written in a way that is suitable for the target ICLR audience which will include , for the most part , readers that are not expert on the entorhinal cortex and/or spatial navigation .",4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B17JTOe0-_R3,"For instance , in the introduction , it is stated that previous attractor network type of models ( which are also recurrent networks ) [...] require hand crafted and fined tuned connectivity patterns , and the evidence of such specific 2D connectivity patterns has been largely absent .",5,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B17JTOe0-_R3,I found the study of the effect of regularization to be potentially the most informative for neuroscience but it is only superficially treated .,3,2,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,"Its not very surprising that adding more tasks and data improves performance on average across downstream tasks , but it is nice to see the experimental results in detail .",3,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,I also like how the authors move beyond the standard sentence tasks to evaluate also on the Quora question duplicate task with different amounts of training data and also consider the sentence characteristic / syntactic property tasks .,3,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,"Regarding the results in Table 2 : The results in Table 2 seem a little bit unstable , as it is unclear which setting to use for the classification tasks ; maybe it depends on the kind of classification being performed .",3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,"Adding parsing as a training task hurts performance on the sentence classification tasks while helping performance on the semantic tasks , as the authors note .",3,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,"Did the authors replicate the results of those methods themselves , or report them from other papers ?",4,4,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,"For other results on these datasets , including stronger results in non fixed dimensional sentence embedding transfer settings , see results and references in Mc Cann et al .",5,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,"For all tasks for which there is additional training , theres a confound due to the dimensionality of the sentence embeddings across papers .",4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,It doesnt make much sense to me to omit pairs with OOVs .,2,2,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,There are much better embeddings on Sim Lex than the embeddings whose results are reported in the table .,4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,Some readers may mistakenly think that the embeddings are SOTA on Sim Lex since no stronger results are provided in the table .,3,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,I feel the motivation for this is lacking .,2,2,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
,B18WgG-CZ_R1,I would suggest adding some motivation for the focus on fixed length representations .,4,3,Deap,29-11-2022,,,,
