ryykVe-0W_R1,"Given this , the authors should indicate more clearly what is their method expected to do .",4,4
,I found every single reading of every theorist mentioned in this article seriously wanting. I will highlight the three most egregious because this review is already getting quite long.,2,2
B1DmUzWAW_R2,I think this information would be very useful to the community in terms of what to take away from this paper .,4,4
rywDjg-RW_R3,The paragraph about key observation III finally reveals some of these details I would suggest moving this much earlier in the introduction .,3,3
B1CQGfZ0b_R2,"The paper isnt presented in exactly these terms , but the idea is to consider a uniform distribution over programs and a zero one likelihood for input output examples ( so observations of I/O examples just eliminate inconsistent programs ) .",3,3

ryykVe-0W_R1,"I would highly recommend the authors to study the review "" Advances in Nonlinear Blind Source Separation "" by Jutten and Karhunen ( 2003/2004 ) to understand the problems they are trying to solve .",5,5
B1DmUzWAW_R3,The result from the paper seems to answer with in all cases but then that always brings the issue of overfitting or parameter tuning issue .,3,3
,What do you mean by [name of scientist]'s conception? Don't you mean ideas? [name of scientist]'s conception took place when his mum and dad made him,2,2
B1CQGfZ0b_R3,The paper did not specify how often the neural net must be trained .,3,3

,You were either in a rush or you do not care too much about getting your paper accepted,2,2
,"Since this is a model formulation paper, there does not need to be a Results section, but if there were, the paper would be easier to follow. There really is no formulation of a model",3,3
,"If I never see another piece of writing started with these lines, it will still be too soon.",1,1
rywHCPkAW_R1,"The proposed approach , Noisy Net , seems very simple and smart : a noise of zero mean and unknown variance is added to each weight of the deep network .",4,4
,"There is potentially an interesting essay to be written about [x], but this one isn't it",2,2
B13EC5u6W_R3,"The idea in the paper is , to my knowledge , novel , and represents a good step toward the important task of generating interpretable visual rationales .",3,3
B13njo1R-_R1,- A second testbed ( such as navigation or manipulation ) would bring the paper up a notch .,3,3
B13njo1R-_R1,The method is simple but novel,3,3
B13njo1R-_R3,"But I want to make sure the authors put a bit more effort into cleaning up the paper , making it more clear and easy to read .",4,4
B16_iGWCW_R1,"- Experimentally , paper would benefit with better comparisons and studies : 1 ) state of the art methods havent been compared against ( e.g .

,I would drop the first clause in the paper title. It does nothing other than degrade the scientific integrity of the work.,3,2
,It appears that publication in any form would be premature at this time.,2,2

,The biggest value of this paper lies in the fact that its pages are bound together.,1,1
,"Having edited many things that have come from Germany, Im in Germany now, Im impressed with the quality of English. Im probably misspelling things in these sentences which may add to the humor. ;-) hard to use this kezboard correctly",2,2

,"It's like you sat around and dreamed up ideas, except they're just castles in the air",1,1
B12Js_yRb_R1,Therefore I recommend reject .,3,3
B12Js_yRb_R1,- The paper doesnt study a simple baseline that just does NMS on the proposal domain .,3,3
B16_iGWCW_R1,Paper would benefit from writing improvements to make it read better .,3,3

,"It is not clear how the of data presented in Figures 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, S1, and S2 was quantified and analyzed.",4,4
B12Js_yRb_R1,"I would recommend the authors to use something more general , like graph convolutional neural networks or graph gated neural networks.",2,2
B12Js_yRb_R1,Contribution : - This paper proposes a new object counting module which operates on a graph of object proposals .,3,3
,The manuscript in the present form is not a review article but is rather a number of research papers stapled together.,2,2
B1DmUzWAW_R1,"In few shot classification , the sequence length can be known a prior .",3,3
B14uJzW0b_R1,"The paper mainly focuses on a specific problem instance , where the weight vectors are unit normed and orthogonal to each other .",3,3
B1CQGfZ0b_R3,These are all points that require discussion which is currently missing from the paper .,3,3
,This is depressing! So much work with so little science,1,1

,This looks like a very early draft,3,3
B11bwYgfM_R3,"In this case , the means are standard deviations do not even make sense to me .",2,2
rywHCPkAW_R1,Is it due to Noisy Net or to the lack of seeds ?,3,3
,The analyses are too statistic,3,3
,It reads like papers often do when they are written in LaTeX. Reject.,2,2
,"...the whole premise just reverted the biosensor field back 20yrs, which has been my biggest single concern regarding this paper.",2,2
,"Quite frankly, it seems that the technical language is used more to frighten and take power over the reader rather than to facilitate the reader in his task, that should be to understand the results of the work (if there are any)",4,4
,I have followed the work of this group for the last few years and know that their submitted work is usually well polished. That is not the case for the present paper.,4,4

,"So the paper, which I was initially excited to read, ended up just making me mad.",2,2
rywHCPkAW_R3,"A comparison to the paper ( s ) by Osband et al ( 2016 , 2017 ) would have also been worth adding .",3,3
rywHCPkAW_R1,At the end of the paper a single experiment investigates the behavior of weights of noise during the learning .,3,3
B16_iGWCW_R2,The wrongly classified samples get large weights such that in the next round those samples will be more likely to get right .,3,3
B1EA-M-0Z_R1,"Here , the sharing is essentially meaningless , because the variance of the weights in this derivation shrinks to zero .",2,2
,I do not believe or trust the data presented or the underlying thesis.,2,2

B16yEqkCZ_R1,"The paper also does not compare to any other techniques that attempt to deal with catastrophic forgetting and/or the changing state distribution ( [ 1,2 ] ) .",3,3
,"Bad, very bad.",1,1
,"The introduction, general approach and data analyses are somewhat anachronistic–this study would have been really interesting 10-15 years ago, but now it seems quite out of date.",4,4
,"Returning to the introduction, the study rationale is unclear, the exact research question to be addressed poorly delineated and the overall motivation for the study poorly linked to the literature summary and aims of the study.",4,4
,this piece…shows no real understanding of history at all,2,2
B14TlG-RW_R2,I feel that the model design is the main reason for the good overall RC performance .,3,3
,I don't know what to 'do' with this.,2,2
,If you want to solve a puzzle you could just do sudoku.,2,2
,"In the end, even after writing a summary of the argument, I am not sure what is the thesis of the essay (or whether there is one) or how and why its parts are connected if I disregard any private knowledge of the topic",3,3
,"To Review of the article was therefore a challenge which I accepted. In fact I regret this decision, at least to some degree.",1,1
B16_iGWCW_R2,Thus the learned weak learner at this round will make different mistakes .,4,4
B17JTOe0-_R1,The paper is overall quite interesting and the study is pretty thorough : no major cons come to mind .,4,4
B12Js_yRb_R1,This is similar to a density map approach and the problem is that the model doesnt develop a notion of instance .,3,3
B11bwYgfM_R3,"Given this , the presentation in the paper makes the idea look more novel than it is .",3,3
B12Js_yRb_R3,Can the author provide analysis on scalability the proposed method ?,4,4
,My first concern is that I don't get it.,2,2
,The authors should refer to the super interesting article on this topic in Wikipedia.,3,3
B14TlG-RW_R1,The proposed data augmentation is a general one and it can be used to improve the performance of other models as well .,3,3
,"While it unfortunately doesn't make for a flashy title (which the authors like more than British tabloids do), there is a simple alternative interpretation of their results",2,2
B16yEqkCZ_R1,This problem does not seem to be really solved by this method .,3,3
,The article could benefit from a good linguistic editing in order for it to be better sound and flowing.,4,4
,The results look like a smorgasbord of data,1,1
rywHCPkAW_R1,The weakness of the proposed approach is the lack of explanation and investigation ( experimental or theoretical ) of why does Noisy work so well .,3,3
B13njo1R-_R3,Please say in the main text that details in terms of architecture and so on are given in the appendix .,5,5
,"As it is often the case with conceptual developments, most of it doesn't make a lot of sense, in the end",3,2
