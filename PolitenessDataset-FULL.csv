ShitMyReviewerSay,,Nobody in their right mind would ever suggest such a model,2,

ShitMyReviewerSay,,I started reading this manuscript with much anticipation but my enthusiasm was short lived.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The authors must know the difference between scientific research and 'news clip' for the Sunday newspaper.,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The presentation is of a standard that I would reject from an undergraduate student,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Ah-now I see a glimpse of promise in this paper,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Your footnote is unnecessary, and indeed confusing. Where did you get the word ""oftentimesâ€ from? We are in the 21st century now.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Also, the authors criticize the approach of [citation of XXX] shortly before introducing their own approach. Seems somewhat hypocritical to me.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,One gets the feeling that the references were included for the sake of having something to refer to.,4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,It is not even wrong,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I don't understand thermodynamics.,3,

ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The whole paper reminds me of a paper of a couple of years ago, which I didn't like.",2,

ShitMyReviewerSay,,"This paper is conceptually unclear, and the causal argument/hypotheses are muddled. In short, it is a mess. I stopped reading after page 7.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I am afraid this manuscript may contribute not so much towards the field's advancement as much as towards its eventual demise.,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Neither research nor science,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,It is shocking to read how statistics are being misused just for the sake of being able to write something... I rate this article as very un-scientific...,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Reviewer 1:
 
 
 Furthermore, the manuscript is very difficult to read due to English problems: combining results and discussion section making it even more confuseReviewer 2: 'The manuscript is poorly written although it can be follow with lots of typos, and a review by a native English speaker is clearly needed.",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"This paper was authored by a keen blogger and his colleagues. The paper perhaps reflects this informal approach, to its detriment.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"So overall we do not recommend a resubmission, but can let you try if you insist",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The ms comes over very much like a group of old wise men sitting around mulling over the terrible state of the world, and opening their hands and saying: well, what can we do about all these terrible things around us",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,In my opinion they are overly reliant on statistical analyses and fail at times to actually see if the observed data agrees with the statistical evaluation.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"[The manuscript's] tone is occasionally too casual, a bit too winking in a David-Foster-Wallace-ish kind of way. This is unfortunately borne out all too clearly in the author's self-presentation on his website, whose home page is inappropriate if not offensive as a professional introduction.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The research claims these phenomena are ""understudied,â€ as though there is some amount of study they should endure.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Putting it unfairly perhaps, and I am sure this is not what is meant, but one ungenerous reading of the proposal is..'",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The data you have are weak, based on very small samples, not clear that they were analyzed properly, and are based on measurements taken in the wrong medium for the organisms. I see little of value in this paper.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Is 'Tartarstan' a magical land where they make all the world's tartar sauce? If not, I can only assume the author is referring to the Russian republic of Tatarstan.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The paper comes with proofs, but – at a first glance – they seem to be more cute than useful.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,You need a comma here. Do they not have commas at your institution or do they just cost a lot?,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"This is a heretofore unobserved result and is very interesting, but is not novel.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"High was my expectation, and so much deeper was my disappointment",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"If the paper is accepted, I strongly recommend an English prof-reading.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Having read through this a couple of times I have ended up feeling rather depressed.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The authors use a log transformation, which is statistical machination, intended to deceive",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,They show they can account for 20% of the variance. NoÂ wonder. The usually accepted level is 50% to be useful.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The introduction, general approach and data analyses are somewhat anachronistic-this study would have been really interesting 10-15 years ago, but now it seems quite out of date.",5,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,It is rather clear that the paper is incomplete and hastily submitted. Note that you failed to provide the contribution number in the acknowledgements. The paper is NOT COMPLETE',2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"But fundamentally, why did you bother?",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Perhaps what you have written is deflating.,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The final section illustrates the paper's poverty. Instead of a summary of the intellectual issues addressed, we are given a series of bland recommendations, the sort of banality that civil servants write for their masters' speeches. It has no place in a serious academic journal.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,None of the following comments on the original manuscript has been correctly reflected or answered,4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The work that this group does is a disgrace to science,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This paper is so devoid of content it should be rejected outright.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I have difficulties identifying the aim and added value of the present study to this topic.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The author gives the impression of having had some mathematical training.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"It is at best of little value and, in the worst case, irrelevant
 
 
 and offensive",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"In a nutshell, I am not sure if the problem is indeed a challenge or just a fact that we have to live with, such as gravity or death, for which no solutions exist.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,It would be charitable to call this a comparison of apples and oranges. It's more like steak and bicycle.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The paper is okay, its not ""wowâ€ but its hard to reject it.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,It is not clear what the author wants to accomplish.,1,

ShitMyReviewerSay,,"claiming 'insights' that rarely amount to very much beyond the bleeding obvious. [..] the problem with jargon is that ""any idiot can pick it up and have a go",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,SURELY THE AUTHORS CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER REFERENCE THAN WIKIPEDIA TO SUPPORT THEIR POINT HERE!,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"As I understand it, you already have good evidence (you've said as much on Facebook). There's no reason to leave this as an open question when you know the answer.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Overall, this paper goes to significant amounts of trouble to accomplish something that is already well established as a technique in a less elegant manner than is currently employed. This paper should not be published.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,These snotty kids in quantum information,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Perhaps I have just read these papers at monthly intervals and the author had bad luck.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This is a terrible sentence. It has so many different things in it and not enough punctuation.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"There is a very interesting story to be conveyed in this paper. The problem is that this interesting story is hidden behind layers of mud, and it is obscured because the paper is poorly written and badly organised.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This code sample cannot be adequately described without the use of strong language.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"My disappointment when finding flawed analyses, conclusions, and terminology [..] was therefore substantial.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,They claim on page 9 a significant improvement of their method. This is stupid!,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,revise this paper at your own risk,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I find myself disagreeing with most of this papers conclusions,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Reviewer 1: The questions in the reviewer comments have been addressed properly in the revised manuscript. I have no more comment before publication. Reviewer 2: I totally agree with the reviewer 1 that this paper is still difficult to read even after revision.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Even if other readers found it comprehensible, there is not even a proposed path to make [this model] into a modeling system.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This is not a paper. This is part of … something. It cannot be reviewed and should be rejected right on.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,All these data are given in the author's Ph.D thesis. Does this material need to be published?,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The paper is blithely silent on the kinds of issues that occupy yards of library shelf-space, [and goes] well beyond what is warranted by the data.",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The system described in the manuscript is inherently confusing. Despite re-reading, its basic elements did not make sense.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,That's not how science is done.,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Considering by the end of the paper I had no idea what was being said, I don't believe the paper was successful in its argument. In fact, it felt like the author was merely saying the same thing over and over again but with synonyms.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I invite the authors to provide compelling, coherent, and quantitative data.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I also do not feel that the lead PI is qualified to undertake this work, or more accurately, that she should undertake this work;",2,

ShitMyReviewerSay,,"This is a pretty trivial study, sample size is suspiciously high, and the effect is tiny at 5% percent difference (who cares if it is significant).",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The study is largely descriptive in nature and mostly a fishing expedition. It will be great if they catch some interesting or unexpected fish.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,this may eventually be a cited paper.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Reading this paper, I am struck by the elegance and clarity of the writing and the ideas. I found myself thinking, “such a simple and obvious idea — why didn’t I think of that?",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This is a perfect example of the worst kind of research in social psychology.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Are you kidding?,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I appreciated how the author seemingly had in mind that a goodly percentage of the readership are not native speakers, so anything too academic or erudite might be lost on them.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"It is very well done, but sits somewhat in isolation from other schools of thought. It is -and I mean this with no disrespect to the author - a sort of echidna or platypus of a paper.",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,My major concern to accept this work-in-progress paper is that these findings areÂ not super interesting to readers in my opinion.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Too mathematically inclined.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I would have preferred to read a meta-analysis,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The abstract proposes the identification of requirements of a future digital infrastructure based on intelligent transportation systems (whatever this is). However, this aim is not fulfilled by the paper'",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,No respectable biochemist would be seen in the same county as these data.,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"If philosophy of science was not taught in the author's doctoral program, (s)he needs to go back and dope slap his/her major professor.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"presumptuous, ignorant and downright dangerous.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The data as presented is not very convincing, even to a believer.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I have started reading this paper with great interest, but as I progressed in reading my interest has decreased significantly.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I could not find any passage in the MS that would explain to me what is the exact novel idea, proposal, argument or hypothesis",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"In the course of this paper many stones were thrown but, unfortunately, no birds were harmed.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"If you aren't going to make to the effort to understand, then you should just give up",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,To my mind the question [the paper is about] is similar to to the medieval debate concerning angels dancing on pinheads. I do not think the paper should be published.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Not good.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,[H] did a few sloppy experiments and attached his name to the great pioneering work by [P]. He should not be mentioned.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Also, the manuscript is very tedious and reads like an unedited thesis chapter.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,A classic instance of reinvention of the square wheel.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Most of the work is methodological rather than scientific, making it somewhat boring.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Unfortunatelly (sic), the paper is very shallow. The results are at the level of a naive master thesis.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This paper does not contain information that could make a scientific proposal.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The fact that the question of this paper has never been askedÂ should, on balance, count against the paper.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,there is no evidence to show this is the first paper to propose the idea,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"In addition, I would suggest either activating the spellchecker on Word, or keeping the cat from walking on your keyboard. I think one of your words was previously employed as a Thunder in 'Finnegan's Wake",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Focus on limitations, because they are many!",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Your discipline doesn't exist,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The article could benefit from a good linguistic editing in order for it to be better sound and flowing.,4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This technique will never work.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I hope you update soon, because I really wanna know what happens next, and how far you are willing to take the potential deconstruction.",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Table 5 is a beast. I have no idea what it is trying to say because it terrifies me,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"It is difficult to see the merits of this proposal, and it is doubtful whether the author has the necessary command of primary and secondary sources to contribute anything to this area of research",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The authors report results from pages 16-26. This section reflects what I would brutally call 'death by figures',1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This is all science done by wishful thinking.,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,To me the question is uninteresting,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This whole paper is wildly speculative and needlessly convoluted.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The paper was so boring I fell asleep halfway through,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Unfortunately I was hoping for more.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I find the title and the main premise of the abstract confusing and illogical. [key concept X] has the logic of a Monty Python sketch,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Having edited many things that have come from Germany, Im in Germany now, Im impressed with the quality of English. Im probably misspelling things in these sentences which may add to the humor. ;-) hard to use this kezboard correctly",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The manuscript can be much kinder to those who are unfamiliar with, or not interested in, the issue.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I would like to urge the authors to improve the language description to make the manuscript much clear and logic. A professional language expert is recommended to use,4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I'm disappointed to say, given the outstanding pedigree of the authors of this paper, that it adds nothing to earlier research.",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Mr. Beard is very courageous when he gives freely so many references to other books, because if a student ever did look at another book, I am sure he would not return again to continue reading Mr. Beard.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Based on theoretical considerations I don't see a reason to perform these experiments.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Although this study, an original work and repetition of earlier feature of these studies is similar. Writing language is quite a lot of grammatical errors",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Unfortunately the manuscript is not well structured and the English is very poor. Usually I would attempt to improve this, but in this case the entire manuscript needs to be reworked - starting with the tittle.",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"First, unless my statistics is failing me, a less than 1.0 SD is not significant.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This is a very weak paper trying to bend things to build a relationship that does not exist (...) Stating X is totally wrong and your data does not support that and no model can state this.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The results are obvious. In fact, so obvious that perhaps no one has bothered to write them down before.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The accompanying simulation movie is neither interesting, nor particularly beautiful.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Why chase a gene in this ridiculous organism?,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Did all 5 authors say,'Yes, this is a piece of work I am proud to have my name on?",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The authors merely used somewhat bigger guns than previous studies and generatedÂ nothing but more smoke.,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The authors should either retract the manuscript or completely revise it after completing the study and by following common scientific standards,4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Limited scholarship, flawed design, and faulty logic engender no enthusiasm whatsoever",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This paper still reads in places more like alternative fan-fiction than scholarship.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The last two sentences of the summary greatly exaggerate the value of this paper and the usefulness of its conclusions.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The authors should discard the data and collect it again properly.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,It seems that the author is simply engaged in proprietary phrase coining - advancing a new term for a well-researched phenomenon,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The author's spelling of coordinate, while technically correct, is arcane and annoying.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This looks like a work of pure fantasy.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Come on please!!!,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I found the paper a challenge to evaluate, expecting some profound methodological or theoretical insight. Yet none appeared to be forthcoming.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The paper is ill-informed and poorly argued. It is not suitable in my view for this or any other journal.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"To Review of the article was therefore a challenge which I accepted. In fact I regret this decision, at least to some degree.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The concluding 'takes a village' sentence is also a bit unoriginal.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"If the editor somehow decides to accept this paper, they risk permanently destroying the credibility of this journal and its entire editorial board.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I retain in my files an anonymous referee's report on an earlier paper that relies heavily on this item. The report stops just short of urging revocation of my degree,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This is a paper struggling not to die,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"There may be a good paper crying to be let out of this manuscript but if so, it is hard to know. The language, not to mention the overuse of symbols, is so dense that one quickly loses track of what was actually measured, what was invented or assumed, and what is being discussed.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Though less enthused about manuscript's novelty, this reviewer does admire the hardworking of your group.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The title is the closest I've seen to manuscript clickbait,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The authors are permitted to believe what they want to, but the data did not support ""important implications.â€",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The writer of the manuscript is utterly ridiculous and appears to believe they will solve poverty through radio astronomy.,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The results look like a smorgasbord of data,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Which means that, as the saying goes, if their results are correct they cannot be new, and if they are “new” they cannot possibly be correct.Frankly, it is hard to say which is the case",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The description of sampling technique is too long and boring!,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Why do you have so many tables? Did you go to Ikea?,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"There are a number of awkward sentences (these occur as early as the abstract), and the writer has a tendency to overburden the sentence. At a deeper level, the argument is at times uninspiring. Nevertheless, the topic is interesting enough.",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Was the white noise random?,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This manuscript is obviously not suitable for publication in high impact factor journals.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I stopped reading the subsequent data reports carefully, because I no longer had confidence that they would be accurate.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Despite promising a very general result this manuscript unfortunately does not deliver (almost) any of the things listed in the abstract.,4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Most part of 'methodology' is useless, most of paragraphs are inrelevant to the main topics.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The title of the paper indicates that the study was an RCT, but was it?",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,There is so much that is wrong with this paper that it is difficult to know where to start,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"There are two possibilities. 1) This paper is part of an experiment to try and determine how badly a research paper can be but still be accepted, or 2) The authors are actual fools and it would be in the editor's best interest to ban them from submitting to the journal in the future.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"So, in summary: the paper is oblique to the entire current literature, it fails to relate such investigations as it reports to the current literatures of the questions to which it claims to be relevant, and it actually acknowledges (in its own last sentence) that the history of the field has simply passed it by. It is as if the grant that it acknowledges for support was awarded in 1990 instead of, oh, 2010 or so.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The ms comes over very much like a group of old wise menÂ sitting around mulling over the terrible state of the world, and openingÂ their hands and saying: well, what can we do about all these terribleÂ things around us",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"While it is true that the authors are under no ""legalâ€ obligation to cite these results, as they are unpublished, they are probably morally obliged to consider what they tell us in comparison with their own results.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Indeed, the article as a whole shows a lack of sophistication and nuance that is diagnostic of the particular genre of thought pieces on the need for studying sex differences that it falls within",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Not now, not ever",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Figure 1. What does ""Minâ€ in panel c stand for?",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This is an area ripe for future research.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"These theoretical results have not been verified experimentally. Therefore, they are wrong",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Are the '10 random reps"" chosen at random?",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,(on a computer simulation paper) 'Did you use software?',2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This work is antithetical to the spirit of [XX research] and will impede potentially important developments.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This article reads like the work of a reasonably competent undergraduate.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,[T]his was one of the least interesting papers that I have read in quite some time.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"In summary, while I believe the work to be valid, timely, original and relevant, I am unable to see in what sense this work accords to the strict journal's criteria.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Is this not the most frightening finding of all?,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The statistical analyses were not correct. Actually they were so confused that I lost all confidence in the analyses and data presentation.,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,You make the reader feel uneducated,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Reject - More holes than my grandad's string vest!,1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,It would be wholly inappropriate to randomize living people to an intervention.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"While the problem is a very important one for modern society, the topic and lessons are not of broad interest.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The discussion is inappropriate and the new content is generally poorly written,4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This is from a methods perspective rather unacceptable in these days of 'voodoo' science.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The fact that something has not been studies is not, in itself, a reason why it should be studied.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"This paper has about the same relevance as a paper in astronomy which places the earth as the centre of the university - while it can be made to look plausible, the basic premises is WRONG.",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Some idea of strategies to define general populations for studies might be helpful both to the reader and to help the authors avoid their meaningless generalities.,4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,What is a 'systematic' review? I have never heard of an unsystematic review.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I cannot possibly imagine what could have led the authors to believe that their paper was remotely interesting enough to submit for publication.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The figure is really not needed. Were I to be shown this by a psychologist, I suspect I would hire a replacement",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Many of the most serious errors are more or less just copied out from what he has read, so it is hard to know how to deal with such cases.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This paper is very weak.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Perhaps my greatest criticism of the paper is the tendancy of the authors to make an argument and then to almost immediately contradict themselves repeatedly.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,proposal language is frightfully unclear.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"This is such a promising topic, but I was very disappointed in this paper combining a substantial amount of author talent.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This looks like a very early draft,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,There are FAR too many analyses and results. The reader is swamped. It's simply not possible to take it all in. It needs to be pruned.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I was really looking forward to reading this manuscript, however this enthusiasm soon waned.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"What, then, is the point of this manuscript, which presents no truly new data, methods, conclusions, or arguments? I would venture that it has no raison d'etre, and is neither novel nor helpful.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Did all 5 authors say,""Yes, this is a piece of work I am proud to have my name on?â€",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Intermediary steps and the apologetics for [topic x] derived from an ahistorical cult and its author.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"I think there is a general problem with the overall goal of this study and area of research. This seems to be making data usage a critical thing people should be paying attention to. People have real issues and I am not at all sure that this one deserves attention. They have real concerns like, are they going to lose their job, where should their children go to college, should they encourage their elderly parents to move into a retirement center.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The conclusion drawn by the authors seems self explanatory and does not require any validation through the presented work,4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The results are new but were predictable.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"This paper represents an example of a piece of work that just crosses the threshold into the category of ""least publishable unitâ€.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I would drop the first clause in the paper title. It does nothing other than degrade the scientific integrity of the work.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"If this topic were not dear to my heart, I would perhaps have struggled to follow your logic. I applaud the effort, and I find the data reviews relatively interesting and useful.",3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"References are incomplete, listing only year and not volume, page numbers, etc. The lack of attention to this detail is a pet peeve.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The title of the submission is misleading and it should be renamed ""A Personal Diaryâ€...",1,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"It is unclear how this would advance the field beyond providing additional, previously unknown information.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Lots of hand waving in this Discussion,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"The biggest problem with this manuscript, which has nearly sucked the will to live out of me, is the terrible writing style.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Once I penetrated the pigeon English, I found very little substance underneath.",2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,However I deplore the fact that this paper has been created at all,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,The current manuscript is deceptive and I do not recommend its publication.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,Despite all my efforts I failed to understand what the actual focus of this paper is,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,This paper contains neither theory nor research.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,I don't know what the heck the red highlighted text is supposed to mean and left it as is.,2,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"My comments indicate, primarily, a concern that you understand the nature of this case study design and the proper role of your case-specific theoretical argumentation, on the one hand, and the case-specific research data, on the other.",4,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,They arbitrarily rule out models with interactions but without corresponding main effects. Etc.,3,
ShitMyReviewerSay,,"Other papers are cited that were clearly not read carefully, resulting in some memorable howlers.",2,

The main idea is to approximate the optimal solution through the use of a set of grid points, and then successively pruning those.   I think the work is solid and sound but perhaps of interest to a fairly limited audience only.   A few typos:   Last sentence of Section 1: ""the works by Bach Bach ... applies""  Caption of Fig.2: the second ""convex"" should be ""concave"".",4,
NeurIPS,206,"I am not an expert on submodular optimization, I therefore only focussed on the convex optimization problem and the coordinate descent algorithm part.  Algorithm 1 is a way how to implement the standard coordinate descent algorithm when probabilities of choosing coordinates are coming from given distribution P.  the description of the algorithm is following the standard in the literature",3,

NeurIPS,786,"The paper proposes co-teaching which uses the result that deep learning models learn easy instances first. One network is used to select the examples for the target network. The paper shows that for two type of noise, Co-teaching outperforms several baselines including Mentornet. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness on vision and language datasets.   I have one suggestion: The paper is mostly empirical and analysis will strengthen the results.",3,
NeurIPS,382,"The authors propose a differentially private algorithm for robust low-rank approximation that improves both the multiplicative approximation and the additive error significantly. They also adapt this algorithm to differentially private robust subspace learning where the additive error does not scale with the size of the dataset but the rank.  It is a well-written, clear paper. The topic is important and the results are significant.",4,
NeurIPS,147,"The paper focuses on developing CNN that is usable at mobile devices. The authors believe that the main problem of massive parameters comes from the convolutional filter, and they introduce spatial- and channel-based versatile filters. Experiments are also well designed, results (especially Table 4) verify the claims raised by the authors. I think it is a neat article, which is acceptable.",4,
NeurIPS,595,"The paper presents a new idea, which is very important in my eyes. The authors propose to jointly train two opposing tasks, in this case an image captioning and image generation model. They prove the effectiveness of their idea, whihc is also of interest for many other applications.",4,

This paper develops a framework for policy improvement that works well in the presence of confounding. ",4,
NeurIPS,9,"This submission is pretty out of my expertise. I just carefully read the intro part and feel it is well written. One question: you show a nice regret upper bound.

Although the tensor notion is not really used in the algorithm, it does well in the limited numerical experiments. To this end, I consider the work a good contribution.  ",4,
NeurIPS,418,This study considers the role  of  third-order smoothness of nonconvex objective functions in the context of stochastic stochastic optimization.
